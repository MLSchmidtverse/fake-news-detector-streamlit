    The **Sus Score** indicates how likely an article is to be fake, based on machine learning analysis.

    **How it works:**

    - An **Overall Sus Score** (0=likely real, 1=likely fake) evaluates the entire article.
    - **Suspicious Paragraphs:** If paragraphs are separated by blank lines in the input, the tool analyzes each paragraph. Paragraphs with high individual scores are highlighted, showing which parts contribute most to suspicion.
    - A higher score means a higher level of suspicion.

    This helps to flag suspicious articles and specific sections for verification. Paragraph analysis depends on the correct formatting of the input.
